    Let's leave it with me
    Just step by step
    Sorry that im quick of foot
    I'll walk your step
    I'm wondering now
    Where is your wings ?
    Tremble lips
    And blurry eyes
    And Your pink cheeks
    Let's leave it with me
    Just step by step
    Sorry that im quick of foot
    I'll walk your step
    I'm wondering now
    Where is your wings ?
    Tremble lips
    And blurry eyes
    And Your pink cheeks
    And we should make the plan
    Then actual date and time, will you?
    You never say for sure
    I wanna know how you think and feel
    That i wanna say is
    People might be watching
    That' is what i'm wanting
    네게 보이는 halo
    Maybe i am weirdo
    All my friends are talkin'
    But i don't give a shit
    눈에 보이는 halo
    Maybe i'm the weirdo
    Let's leave it with me
    Just step by step
    Sorry that im quick of foot
    I'll walk your step
    I'm wondering now
    Where is your wings ?
    tremble lips
    And blurry eyes
    And Your pink cheeks
    And we should make the plan

    Maybe i am weirdo
    All my friends are talkin'
    But i don't give a shit
    눈에 보이는 halo
    Maybe i'm the weirdo
    Say that you're the one i need
    I loved you since i kissed your cheeks
    Say that you're the one i need
    I loved you since i kissed your cheeks

    묻지마 묻지마 My life

    지금 걱정은 다 내일 해

    다 귀찮아 피곤해 왜

    이렇게 사는 게 어때

    앞에서 뒤에서 Hate me

    신경 안 쓸 거야 yeah yeah yeah

    어쩜 난 쿨 하지가 못해 뭐 어때 woo

    괜찮아 니가 날 볼 때

    답답해 이해 안된 대도 OK

    Wake up wake up wake up

    바뀔 맘 없어 꿈 깨

    woo

    Just like sunday morning

    woo

    날 좀 내버려 둘래

    생각이 너무 많아도 몸이 무거워

    그럴 때는 비워 버려 SO WHAT

    쉽게 생각해 SO WHAT

    이래도 될까 싶을 정도로 비워 둬

    You know 때론 때론 천천히 가도 돼

    이렇게 말해봐 SO WHAT

    늦게 자도 돼 늦게까지 자도 돼

    씻지 않는 건 별로 싫지 않은 걸

    조금 살이 쪄도 걱정하지 마마

    몸무게는 그저 숫자일 뿐 야야

    Wait wait wait wait

    언젠가 더 크게 부담이 될 거라고

    It's OK It's OK

    걱정마 괜찮아

    나중 일 나중에

    고민해도 되잖아

    woo

    Just like sunday morning

    woo

    날 좀 내버려 둘래

    생각이 너무 많아도 몸이 무거워

    그럴 때는 비워 버려 SO WHAT

    쉽게 생각해 SO WHAT

    이래도 될까 싶을 정도로 비워 둬

    You know 때론 때론 천천히 가도 돼

    이렇게 말해봐 SO WHAT

    I think we need to just take it slow

    복잡하게 생각하지 말고 Let it go

    I think we need to just take it slow

    틀린 게 아니고 다른 것뿐 You should know

    S.T.A.Y.C GO

    생각이 너무 많아도 몸이 무거워

    그럴 때는 비워 버려 SO WHAT

    쉽게 생각해 SO WHAT

    이래도 될까 싶을 정도로 비워 둬

    You know 때론 때론 천천히 가도 돼

    Why you callin' at 11:30
    When you only wanna do me dirty
    But I hit right back
    'cause you got that that, yeah
    Why you always wanna act like lovers
    But you never wanna be each other's
    I say don't look back but I go right back and
    All the sudden I'm hypnotized
    You're the one that I can't deny
    Every time that I say I'm gonna walk away

    When you leave and then you
    leave me stressing?
    But I cant stay mad
    when you walk like that, no
    Why you always wanna act like lovers
    But you never wanna be each other's
    I say don't look back but I go right back and
    All a sudden I'm hypnotized
    You're the one that I can't deny
    Every time that I say I'm gonna walk away
    You turn me on like a light switch
    When your movin'
    your body around and around
